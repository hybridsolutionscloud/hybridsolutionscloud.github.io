		<p>
			Based in the western mountains of Virginia, Kristopher brings together a deep technical background with a craftsman‚Äôs mindset. As a Product Technology Architect and hybrid cloud consultant, he has helped public and private sector organizations transform their infrastructure using Microsoft-native technologies.

That same attention to detail, patience, and resilience carries into the hybrid architectures he designs‚Äîreliable, repeatable, and built to last.
